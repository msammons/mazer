This document tracks known issues, bugs, and potential improvements for the Shark Robot Maze game.

## Legend
- ðŸ”´ Critical: Game-breaking or major functionality issues
- ðŸŸ  High: Significant issues that affect gameplay
- ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Noticeable issues that should be addressed
- ðŸ”µ Low: Minor issues or enhancements
- ðŸŸ¢ Testing Note: Observations for testing

## Current Issues

### ðŸ”´ Robots Not Moving
- **Issue**: The purple squares (enemies) are not moving
- **Repro Steps**:
  1. Start the game
  2. Observe the purple squares in the maze
- **Expected**: Enemies should move around the maze
- **Actual**: Enemies remain stationary
- **Priority**: High - Core gameplay element not functioning
- **Status**: Confirmed

## Fixed Issues

### âœ… Invisible Wall in Maze (Fixed in #1)
- **Issue**: There was an invisible wall between positions (5,3) and (6,3) that blocked player movement
- **Root Cause**: A hardcoded check in the movement logic was preventing movement between these specific tiles
- **Fix**: Removed the hardcoded center wall check in `src/player/movement.ts`
- **Verification**: Player can now move freely between positions (5,3) and (6,3)
- **Date Fixed**: 2024-06-14

### ðŸŸ¢ Testing Note: Maze Layout
- **Observation**: Some maze paths may be too narrow, making it difficult to navigate
- **Suggestion**: Consider adjusting the maze layout for better playability

### ðŸŸ¢ Testing Note: Visual Feedback
- **Observation**: No visual feedback when player is caught by a robot
- **Suggestion**: Add a visual effect or animation when the player is caught

## Testing Protocol

- P: Pause game (if implemented)

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Movement**
   - Verify player can move in all four directions
   - Verify player cannot move through walls
   - Verify smooth movement between tiles

2. **Robot Behavior**
   - Verify robots move continuously
   - Verify robots change direction at intersections
   - Verify robots don't get permanently stuck

3. **Collisions**
   - Verify collision detection with walls
   - Verify what happens when player collides with a robot
   - Verify robots don't overlap with each other

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Test behavior at map boundaries
   - Test behavior when multiple direction keys are pressed
   - Test rapid direction changes

## Performance Notes
- Monitor frame rate during gameplay
- Check for memory leaks during extended play
- Test on different screen sizes and devices
